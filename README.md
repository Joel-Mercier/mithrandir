# Home Lab Setup

## TODO

- [ ] Implement a backup strategy for all apps using Google Drive and test a full recovery scenario
- [ ] Replace Uptime Kuma with Gatus which has support for file based configuration (could allow to setup alerts and monitoring directly in the script without using the UI)
- [ ] Check if Profilarr is a good solution for quality profiles
- [ ] Check if Wholphin is a good replacement TV app for Jellyfin & Jellyseerr
